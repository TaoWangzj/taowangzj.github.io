<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a researcher, working on low-level vision and multimodal generation. Before that, I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University (NJU), 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Tong lu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/). From September 2024 to March 2025, I worked as an academic intern at VIVO (Shanghai). I have published over 40+ peer-reviewed papers in top-tier journals and conferences, like IJCV, TIP, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, SIGGRAPH, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM, etc. I am a reviewer for TPAMI, TIP, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, SIGGRAPH, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, etc.




Here is my <a href="/images/Taowang_CV.pdf?v=1" target="_blank">[CV]</a>, and you can contact me by E-mail: [taowangzj@gmail.com](mailto:taowangzj@gmail.com).

# Research
I am interested in several topics in computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, my research focuses on creative AI, such as image/video enhancement and synthesis, AI generated content (AIGC).
